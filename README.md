# Welcome to "Relationship Between Weather Factors in Barcelona and Electricity Prices in Spain" Project!

In this project, I aim to test two hypotheses related to electricity prices in Spain. The first hypothesis is that temperatures, wind speed, and solar radiation in Barcelona are directly related to the price of electricity. The second hypothesis investigated if the regions that produce the most wind energy (Zaragoza) and solar energy (Cáceres) have a more significant correlation with electricity prices in Spain.

## Dataset

I collected data using web scraping and API techniques. I scraped electricity prices data from OMIE (The Iberian Electricity Market Operator), and weather data from OpenWeatherMap API for various regions in Spain.

## Hypotheses

I formulated two hypotheses to test:

Hypothesis 1: The prices of electricity in Spain are directly related to weather factors such as temperature, wind speed, and radiation in Barcelona.

Hypothesis 2: The electricity prices in Spain have a more significant correlation with the regions that produce the most wind energy (Zaragoza) and solar energy (Cáceres).

## Methodology

I use Python as our main programming language and popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

    Data Collection: In this section, I will load and clean the data, prepare it for analysis, and combine it into a single dataset.

    Data Exploration and Visualization: In this section, I will explore the data by creating various visualizations and gain insights into the different hypotheses. I will use different types of plots such as scatterplots, line charts, and heatmaps to effectively convey the findings.

    Hypothesis Testing: In this section, I will test our hypotheses using regression analysis to determine the correlation between the variables.

    Conclusion: Finally, I will summarize the findings of the project and provide conclusions based on the results obtained from the data analysis.

## Conclusion

Thank you for joining me on this journey of exploring the relationship between weather factors in Barcelona and electricity prices in Spain. I hope you find the insights gained from this analysis informative and interesting. Please refer to the individual sections for detailed analysis and findings. Feel free to provide feedback and suggestions for further improvement. Happy exploring!
